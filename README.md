# Live Search Buggy Starter

A Next.js live search application demo with TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

## Features

- Real-time search functionality
- Course database with filtering
- Responsive design
- TypeScript support

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Copy environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js app router pages and API routes
- `components/` - React components
- `data/` - JSON data files
- `app/api/search/` - Search API endpoint

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/search?q=term` - Search for courses

## Development

## Hydration Error Fix

### Hydration Error 1: Non-deterministic Key

**Error:**

```
Warning: Text content did not match. Server: "49888.26" Client: "50055.56"
```

**Cause:**
Using a non-deterministic key (`key={Math.random()}`) in the `Search` component when rendering search results. This causes the server-rendered and client-rendered DOM to mismatch.

**Solution:**
Use a stable and unique key for each result item, specifically `key={result.id}` instead of `key={Math.random()}`.

### Hydration Error 2: Non-deterministic Calculation in Render

**Error:**

```
Warning: Text content did not match. Server: "50068.11" Client: "50033.70"
```

**Cause:**
The value for `calculatedValue` was generated by calling a random calculation (`calculateRandomSum()`) directly in the render. This produces a different value on the server and client, causing a hydration mismatch.

**Solution:**
Move the random calculation into a `useEffect` and store the result in state. This ensures the value is only generated on the client after hydration, preventing mismatches.

The search functionality includes:

- Live search as you type
- Course filtering by title, description, and category
- Loading states and error handling
- Responsive UI with TailwindCSS
